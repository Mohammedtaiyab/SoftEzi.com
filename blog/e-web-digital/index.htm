They make 75% of decisions about buying<br>new homes, and 81% of the decisions about groceries. They influence at least 80% of all<br>household spending.<br>The Internet is meant for all, then why we hear less of female names when it comes down to<br>digital marketing, technology, or so? Is there actually a gender-bias issue in the Internet<br>industry?
