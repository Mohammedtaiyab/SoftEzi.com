This medium of marketing has become the most profitable and<br>efficient for organization and companies to sell their product through digital marketing. To<br>channelize your products or services, there should be gap to bridge, that’s virtual marketing.<br>Marketing is basically strategized by 4 P’s, &amp; the 4 P’s are product, price, place and promotion.<br>Marketing is nothing but the activity of promoting through print media, broadcast and outdoor<br>importantly.<br>21 st century is the edge of digitization and boom in this has led to increase in use of digital<br>media in business services.&nbsp;<a href="http://ewebdigital.com/digitalmarketing.html">Digital marketing&nbsp;</a>is a part of marketing but marketing or traditional<br>marketing is a separate entity from digital marketing. The real reason why digital marketing is<br>ramping the graph of success because you can reach millions of customers, known or unknown<br>by reaching people through internet, social media and search engines. Digital marketing<br>indulges in promoting activities through electronic devices such as&nbsp;<a href="http://ewebdigital.com/mobileapp.html">smartphones, Apps</a>,<br><a href="http://ewebdigital.com/webdevelopment.html">websites</a>, search engines &amp; E-mails. Everything between search engines to instagram and other<br>internet platforms come under&nbsp;<a href="http://ewebdigital.com/digitalmarketing.html">digital marketing.</a><br><strong>Why Digital Marketing?<br></strong>At this stage, digital marketing is vital for your business and brand awareness. It seems like<br>every other brand has a website. And if they don’t, they at least have a social media presence<br>or digital ad strategy. Digital content and marketing is so common that consumers now expect<br>and rely on it as a way to learn about brand. Digital marketing is result oriented technology,<br>hence helps track your target audience and customers. With help of this trending platform and<br>electronic media you will always know who is viewing ads, who is buying and also who is liking<br>it. In many ways, digital marketing is no different than traditional marketing.<br>In both, smart organizations seek to develop mutually beneficial relationships with prospects,<br>leads, and customers. Digital marketing is something, which plays an important role in every<br>marketing field such as PR, media and communication. A marketing professional, without the<br>knowledge of digital marketing can be left behind in career. On the contrary, a marketing<br>professional with proper knowledge and certificates of digital marketing can expect significantly<br>higher growth in terms of designation and salary.</p>

<p><strong>How Does Digital Marketing Work?</strong><br>If your prospects begin to search for a business similar to yours and are able to find your<br>competitors’ website but not yours, your business is not even in the running. Your prospects<br>can’t choose you if they don’t know about you. In this scenario, your competitors have just<br>raced ahead of you regardless of whether they have an effective website or a clear message.<br>As an example…<br>Think about the last important purchase you made. Perhaps you purchased a home, hired<br>someone to fix your roof, or changed paper suppliers at your office.<br>Regardless of what it was, you probably began by searching the Internet to learn more about<br>available solutions, who provided them, and what’s your best options were. Your ultimate<br>buying decision was then based on the reviews you read, the friends and family you consulted,<br>and the solutions, features, and pricing you researched.<br>Most purchasing decisions begin online.<br>That being the case, an online presence is absolutely necessary, regardless of what you sell.<br>The key is to develop a digital marketing strategy that puts you in all the places your followers<br>are already hanging out, then using a variety of digital channels to ;</p>



<ol><li>Connect with business associates in multiple aspects for conversion.</li><li>Keep them updated with industry insights, problems they’re facing, and how to solve those<br>problems.</li><li>Usage of social media applications for sharing content and then engage them as friends and<br>followers.</li><li>Get your content optimized using Search Engine Optimization (SEO), so it will show up when<br>someone is searching for the relevant information you’ve written about.</li><li>Market yourself through advertisement to drive paid traffic to your website, where you can<br>catch attention through offers.</li><li>And email marketing to follow up with your audience to be sure they continue to get the<br>solutions they’re looking for.<br>This complete package will help you build your own digital marketing campaign without the<br>false starts and missteps that come with doing it alone.</li></ol>



<p><strong>Digital Marketing: A growing career for women’s?</strong></p>



<p>“A girl should be<br>two things: Who and what she wants.” – Coco<br>Chanel</p>



<p>Becoming a leader in the digital marketing world can be quite difficult.<br>Sadly, while we would like to hear different scenarios because of cultural mindsets and<br>practiced behaviors, this can sometimes be a little more difficult for women.<br>That being said, there are still countless warrior-like women who fight their way to the top of<br>the corporate ladder, and some who just build their own ladder.<br>Women have a very important role in the progress of any country. 49.6% population is<br>governed by women around the world which is almost the half of the world’s population.<br>Talking about India, 65.2 crore are held by women with the sex ratio of 945 females per 1000<br>males. With this huge coverage, women today are making their own mark and presence felt<br>almost in every field. They have realized that they need to rise high and make their own journey<br>successful. Even politically, the Prime Minister has been promoting the women-centric<br>campaigns like ‘ Beti Bachao ’&nbsp;and ‘ Selfie with Daughter ’ campaigns just to make people<br>aware and remind that women are equivalent to men and can contribute well enough in the<br>country’s success.</p>



<p>Women’s&nbsp;economic empowerment&nbsp;refers to the ability for women to enjoy their right to<br>control and benefit from the resources,&nbsp;assets,&nbsp;income&nbsp;and their own time, as well as the ability<br>to&nbsp;manage risk&nbsp;and improve their economic status and wellbeing. As 21st century women’s are<br>more passionate about their goals and career, they try to expand their wings in each and every<br>field.<br>According to Marti Barletta, author of&nbsp;Marketing to Women, women are the primary decision-<br>makers for consumer goods in 85% of households. They make 75% of decisions about buying<br>new homes, and 81% of the decisions about groceries. They influence at least 80% of all<br>household spending.<br>The Internet is meant for all, then why we hear less of female names when it comes down to<br>digital marketing, technology, or so? Is there actually a gender-bias issue in the Internet<br>industry? Well, the question has been raised many times, but often, the debates and<br>discussions are based on nothing but speculation!</p>
